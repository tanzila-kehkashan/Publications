## 🎯 Highlights
- Comprehensive theoretical and empirical evaluation of software quality models
- Comparative analysis of Maccalls, Bohem, FURPS, ISO, and CMM quality models
- Framework for theoretical and experiential assessment of software quality processes
- User class-based approach for quality model evaluation

## 📋 Abstract

The quality of software is measured and maintained by quality models like Maccalls, Bohem, FURPS, ISO, and CMM. This research presents an appraisal of software quality models through both theoretical and empirical approaches. The theoretical appraisal helps select models on a theoretical basis, while empirical analysis validates performance. For given quality criteria, theoretical procedures measure process quality models, and experiential appraisal evaluates model performance. Different organizations developing software use various models, and this study provides theoretical and experiential evaluation to measure software quality effectively.

## 📊 Key Contributions

### 1. Theoretical Assessment Framework
- **User Class-Based Approach:** Defines different user classes (developers, managers, customers) with specific requirements
- **Requirement Set Analysis:** R1, R2, R3 representing user-specific requirements mapped to quality models
- **Correctness Evaluation:** Three-level assessment (Satisfied, Partially Satisfied, Not Satisfied)

### 2. Empirical Assessment Approach
- **Comparative Performance Analysis:** Evaluates models across multiple case studies
- **Model Content Evaluation:** Both dependent and independent content analysis
- **Real-world Validation:** Applied to University of Durham and GNU GCC projects

### 3. Quality Models Evaluated

| Model | Focus Area | Key Features |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **ISO 9001:1994** | Quality assurance standards | Process-oriented approach |
| **SPICE v1.3** | Process improvement | Capability assessment |
| **SW-CMM v1.3** | Maturity model | Five maturity levels |

| Process Control | 0% | 66.67% | Medium |

## 🔬 Methodology

### Theoretical Evaluation Process
1. **Requirement Definition:** Establish complete set of quality requirements
2. **Model Analysis:** Examine model content against requirements
3. **User Class Mapping:** Associate requirements with specific user groups
4. **Validation:** Verify theoretical soundness and completeness

### Empirical Evaluation Process
1. **Case Study Selection:** Choose representative software processes
2. **Model Application:** Apply quality models to real-world scenarios
3. **Performance Measurement:** Quantify model effectiveness
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Benchmark across different models
